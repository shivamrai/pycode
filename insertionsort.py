""" Insertion sort Algorithm 
Every repetition of insertion sort removes an element from the input data, 
and inserts it into the correct position in the already-sorted list until no input elements remain. 
Sorting is typically done in-place. 
The resulting array after k iterations has the property where the first k + 1 entries aresorted.
Each element greater than x is copied to the right as it is compared against x. 
Basically there are 2 portions of a list, sorted one and unsorted one. This algo transfers elements from 
unsorted portion to sorted portion."""
